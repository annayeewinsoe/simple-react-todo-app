         <p>Hi! My name is <strong>Su Pyae Yee</strong> and this is the <strong>first react app</strong> that I built. I finally managed to build an app after watching many tutotials. The theme of the app is yellow, don't ask me why, I don't know why I decided to choose yellow, and the funny font style too. I think todo apps are very basic and simple so I don't want to bored you with some serious styles. That's why I made this theme.</p>
         <p>Hope you like it.</p>
      </div>
